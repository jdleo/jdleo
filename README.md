hey, I'm an SDE2 at Amazon (started 9/2021). previously was at IBM (started 8/2020).

- expertise is in distributed systems
- can build pretty much anything (event driven architectures, scaleable APIs (100k+ TPS), AI services; whether that be live inference clusters with triton + ECS or just chatgpt wrappers lol, blockchain stuff)
- can migrate pretty much anything (lift and shifts w/ live traffic, rearchitecting, stack repolishing)
- most comfortable with java/python/typescript/javascript/rust/go/elixir/solidity/c++ and aws.
