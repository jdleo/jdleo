## hi there 👋

I'm John, and I'm currently **Software Engineer II** at [Amazon](https://amazon.com), working on highly-scaled (over 100,000 TPS), low-latency distributed systems. These systems are event-drive, anomaly detection systems and event firehoses that help make Amazon logistics more efficient in the warehouses, fulfillment centers, and when drives are en route. I was formerly at [IBM](https://ibm.com), working on distributed systems & microservices over there.
