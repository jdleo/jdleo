hey :)

**experience:**
- Amazon (started 9/2021), worked in last mile logistics at first then switched to search science
- IBM (started 8/2020), worked in iX primarily in gov sector

**what I am ok at:**
- expertise is in distributed systems
- can build a few things (event driven architectures, scaleable APIs (100k+ TPS), AI services; whether that be live inference clusters with triton + ECS or just chatgpt/claude wrappers lol, blockchain stuff)
- can migrate pretty much anything (lift and shifts w/ live traffic, rearchitecting, stack repolishing)
- most comfortable with java/python/typescript/javascript/rust/go/elixir/solidity/c++ and aws.
