## hi there 👋

I'm John, and I'm currently **Software Engineer II** at [Amazon](https://amazon.com), working working on highly-scaled (over 100,000 TPS), low-latency distributed systems that live in the Amazon Search stack. These systems are an essential component to the Amazon Search stack and are the main reason when you search for "nike red shoes", the results are more relevant 😊 I was formerly at [IBM](https://ibm.com), working on distributed systems & microservices over there.
